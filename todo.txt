-swiftpp: handle static method, there is code for it but I don't think it works ?
-swiftpp: add tests:
	virtual, non-virtual, pure virtual, static method,
	methods with default parameters, overloads, const/non-const
	inheritance, multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance
	
-swiftpp: handle collections automatically, vector to NSArray, map to NSDict
-swiftpp: simplify usage ?
-examples: improve simple example, it's very lame now
-examples: write a more complexe example
-better readme
-detect std::shared_ptr<T> and make them work with ARC on the Objective-C/swift side

much more I'm sure...
