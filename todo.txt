-swiftpp: handle static method, there is code for it but I don't think it works ?
-swiftpp: add tests:
	-constructor with params
	-virtual override call from swift
	-virtual override call from c++
	-non virtual override call from swift
	-non virtual override call from c++
	-pure virtual override call from swift
	-pure virtual override call from c++
	-pure virtual not override call from c++
	-pure virtual not override call from swift
	-inheritance
	-multiple inheritance
	-virtual inheritance
	-type conversion
	-simple collection handling
	-complex collection handling
	-complex collection handling with user type

-swiftpp: handle collections automatically, vector to NSArray, map to NSDict, things like map<string,vector<set<int>>> should have convertes automatically generated.
-swiftpp: simplify usage/setup in Xcode ?
-examples: improve simple example, it's very lame now
-examples: write a more complexe example
-detect std::shared_ptr<T> and make them work with ARC on the Objective-C/swift side. right now, swift only sees copies of C++ objects.

-since the goal is to parse portable C++ code to generate bridge to platform specific code, could we also generate a JNI bridge for use on Android ?!

much more I'm sure...
